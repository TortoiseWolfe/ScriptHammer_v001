🎬 **Just open-sourced FirstFrame** - a planning template that helps you see your project clearly before writing code.

The name is wordplay:
🎯 **First Frame** - like a movie's opening shot, establish your vision first
👓 **Specs** - specifications AND glasses for clear vision
🖼️ **Frames** - wireframes that hold your vision in place

✨ **Specs + Frames = clear vision, properly supported.**

**The workflow:**
1. 📜 Define your project constitution
2. 📋 Write feature specs with user stories
3. 🖼️ Generate SVG wireframes
4. 🤖 Feed it all to your AI

🧩 **Why SVGs?** They're text-based XML. Your AI can read them and understand: "3-column layout, sidebar nav, data table, detail panel." Way better than describing UI in prose.

📦 **What's included:**
- 🖥️ Interactive wireframe viewer (pan/zoom/keyboard nav)
- 🎨 Example component library
- ⚙️ GitHub's SpecKit commands built-in
- 🌗 Dark/light theme support

⚡ **Ready to build?** Fork ScriptHammer for Next.js 15 + React 19 + Supabase foundation. GitHub's SpecKit commands are built-in.

👀 **Live viewer:** https://tortoisewolfe.github.io/First-Frame/design/wireframes/
🍴 **Fork it:** https://github.com/TortoiseWolfe/First-Frame

🛑 Stop coding before you know what you're building. See your project clearly from the first frame. 🎬
