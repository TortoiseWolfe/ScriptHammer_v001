## Copy Below This Line

🎬 Every great film starts with a single frame.

Before the action, before the drama, before the audience gasps - there's that first image that sets everything in motion.

Building software should work the same way.

I just open-sourced FirstFrame - a planning template that helps you see your project clearly before writing a single line of code.

🎭 THE NAME IS INTENTIONAL WORDPLAY

🎯 "First Frame" - Like the opening shot of a movie, you need to establish your vision before the story unfolds. Start at the beginning. See the whole picture before you build it.

👓 "Specs" - These are your specifications, the detailed requirements that define what you're building. But specs are also glasses - the lenses through which you see your project with crystal clarity.

🖼️ "Frames" - The wireframes that hold your vision in place. Just like glasses have frames that support the lenses, your UI wireframes provide the structure that supports your specifications. They're the skeleton that gives shape to your ideas.

✨ Specs + Frames = clear vision, properly supported.

---

📋 THE WORKFLOW

Here's how FirstFrame works:

1. 📜 Define your project constitution - Your vision statement that guides everything
2. 📋 Write feature specifications - User stories and acceptance criteria
3. 🖼️ Generate SVG wireframes - Visualize every screen in your app
4. 🤖 Feed it all to your AI - Let your LLM understand exactly what you're building

That last point is where the magic happens.

🧩 WHY SVG WIREFRAMES?

SVGs are text-based XML. When you create wireframes as SVGs, you're not just making pretty pictures - you're generating structured, semantic context that an LLM can actually understand.

Your AI assistant can read an SVG and know: "This is a 3-column layout. The sidebar has navigation. The main content has a data table. The detail panel shows the selected item."

That's infinitely more useful than describing your UI in prose. The wireframe becomes documentation that both humans AND machines can understand.

📦 WHAT'S INCLUDED

FirstFrame comes with everything you need to start planning:

🖥️ Interactive Wireframe Viewer - Pan, zoom, keyboard navigation. View your wireframes in context with an elegant dark-themed interface.

🎨 Example Component Library - Buttons, forms, cards, tables, status indicators. Use these patterns as starting points for your own component specifications.

⚙️ GitHub's SpecKit Built-In - The full SpecKit workflow is integrated. Define specs, clarify requirements, generate wireframes, plan implementation - all with simple slash commands.

🌗 Dark and Light Themes - Generate wireframes in either theme to match your project's aesthetic.

📱 RESPONSIVE FROM DAY ONE

Plan your mobile experience alongside desktop. The template includes mobile layout patterns so you're thinking responsive from the first frame.

🚀 GETTING STARTED

1. Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/First-Frame.git
cd First-Frame

2. Start Claude Code
claude

3. Begin planning
/speckit.constitution   (Define your vision)
/speckit.specify        (Create feature specs)
/speckit.clarify        (Refine requirements)
/wireframe              (Generate wireframes)

---

⚡ WHEN YOU'RE READY TO BUILD

Your specs and wireframes become the blueprint. Two paths forward:

Option A: Fork ScriptHammer
https://scripthammer.com provides a ready-to-use foundation with Next.js 15, React 19, Supabase, and Tailwind. Your FirstFrame planning artifacts become rich context for implementation.

Option B: Stay in FirstFrame
Use the full SpecKit workflow right here: /speckit.plan, /speckit.tasks, /speckit.implement. Your specs and wireframes guide development without switching repos.

---

🛑 Stop coding before you know what you're building.
