## Copy Below This Line

🎬 Every great film starts with a single frame. Before the action, before the drama, before the audience gasps - there's that first image that sets everything in motion.

Building software should work the same way.

I just open-sourced FirstFrame - a planning template that helps you see your project clearly before writing a single line of code.

The name is intentional wordplay:

🎯 "First Frame" - like the opening shot of a movie, you need to establish your vision before the story unfolds. Start at the beginning. See the whole picture before you build it.

👓 "Specs" - these are your specifications, the detailed requirements that define what you're building. But specs are also glasses - the lenses through which you see your project with crystal clarity.

🖼️ "Frames" - the wireframes that hold your vision in place. Just like glasses have frames that support the lenses, your UI wireframes provide the structure that supports your specifications. They're the skeleton that gives shape to your ideas.

✨ Specs + Frames = clear vision, properly supported.

Here's the workflow:

1. 📜 Define your project constitution (your vision statement)
2. 📋 Write feature specifications with user stories and acceptance criteria
3. 🖼️ Generate SVG wireframes that visualize every screen
4. 🤖 Feed all of this context into your AI development pipeline

That last point is where the magic happens.

🧩 SVGs are text-based. They're XML. When you create wireframes as SVGs, you're not just making pretty pictures - you're generating structured, semantic context that an LLM can actually understand.

Your AI assistant can read an SVG and know: "This is a 3-column layout. The sidebar has navigation. The main content has a data table. The detail panel shows the selected item."

That's infinitely more useful than describing your UI in prose.

📦 The FirstFrame template includes:

🖥️ An interactive wireframe viewer with pan, zoom, and keyboard navigation
🎨 Example component library SVG demonstrating UI patterns (create your own from your specs)
⚙️ GitHub's SpecKit workflow commands built-in: https://github.com/github/spec-kit
🌗 Dark and light theme support for your wireframes

⚡ When you're ready to implement, your specs and wireframes become the blueprint. Fork ScriptHammer for a Next.js 15 + React 19 + Supabase + Tailwind foundation: https://scripthammer.com

Let your LLM turn your FirstFrame planning artifacts into working code.

🛑 Stop coding before you know what you're building.
